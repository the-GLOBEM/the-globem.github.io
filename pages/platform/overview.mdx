# Overview

GLOBEM not only supports flexible and rapid evaluation of the existing behavior modeling methods,
but also provides easy-to-extend templates for researchers to develop and prototype their own behavior modeling algorithms.

It splits the whole pipeline into three independent modules:
- The `feature preparation module` defines behavior features used by the algorithm.
- The `model computation module` defines how a behavior model is going to be trained. These two modules are determined by the core algorithm.
- The `configuration module` provides the flexibility to adjust hyperparameters in the algorithm.

Researchers and developers can re-use or re-purpose any of these modules to develop new algorithms within the pipeline.
GLOBEM separates the configuration setup from the model definition, supporting easy testing and ablation studies of hyperparameters and different features.

Moreover, GLOBEM provides a series of generalization evaluation tasks to enable rapid testing of any algorithm.

## Quick Start

Try the plaform with one line of command, assuming Anaconda/miniconda is already installed on the machine.
Please find the details of the setup and examples explained in the rest of tutorial.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UW-EXP/GLOBEM.git
cd GLOBEM
/bin/bash run.sh
```

<sup> Our platform is tested with Python 3.7 under MacOS 11.6 (intel) and CentOS 7. </sup>


## Available Algorithms

The platform currently supports the task of **depression detection** and closely reimplements the following algorithms:
