# Setup

## Environment

The GLOBEM is a python-based platform. Here is an example of using Anaconda or miniconda for environment setup:

```shell
conda create -n globem python=3.7
conda activate globem
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

Example raw data are provided in our Github `data_raw` folder. 
Please refer to the [GLOBEM Dataset page](/dataset/overview) for more details about the raw data format.

A simple script is prepared to process these raw data.
As different subjects may have a different amount of data, 
the main purpose of the processing is to slice the data into standard (`feature matrix`, `label`) pairs (see XXX in the next page for specific definitions).

The preparation can be done by running
```shell
python data/data_prep.py
```
