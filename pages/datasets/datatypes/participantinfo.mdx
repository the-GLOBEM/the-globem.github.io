## Data Files

The `ParticipantInfoData` folder contains files with additional information about participants.
- `platform.csv`: The file contains each participant's major smartphone platform (iOS or Android), indexed by `pid`
- `demographics.csv`: Due to privacy concerns, demographic data (age, gender, racial group, etc.) are only available for special requests. Please reach out to us directly with a clear research plan with demographic data.
