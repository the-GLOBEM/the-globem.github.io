# Sleep Feature

We leverage sleep-related features from [RAPIDS-Fitbit-Sleep](https://www.rapids.science/1.6/features/fitbit-sleep-intraday/), including high-level summary features (total duration of being asleep or in bed), 
and low-level features about the statistics (count, mean, max, min) of episodes of being asleep, restless, and awake during the sleep.
