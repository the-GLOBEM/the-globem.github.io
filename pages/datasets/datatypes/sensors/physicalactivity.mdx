# Physical Activity Feature

We utilize physical activity features from [RAPIDS-Fitbit-Steps](https://www.rapids.science/1.6/features/fitbit-steps-intraday/). They include both high-level features (number of steps, duration of being active), 
and low-level features about the statistics of active or sedentary episodes (mean, std, max, min).
