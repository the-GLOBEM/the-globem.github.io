# Phone Usage Features

We include all features in [RAPIDS-Screen](https://www.rapids.science/1.6/features/phone-screen/) 
that cover the statistics of unlocking episodes (count, sum, mean, std, max, min).

We further contextualize these features at different locations (home and study places) to capture fine-grained phone usage behaviors.
