# Location Features

We incorporate all features in [RAPIDS-Location](https://www.rapids.science/1.6/features/phone-locations/),  which includes location variance, location entropy, travel distance, etc. 

In addition, we also added more features (duration of staying) for specific points of interest, 
including places for living, study, exercise, and relaxation. The following tables list out specific features.
