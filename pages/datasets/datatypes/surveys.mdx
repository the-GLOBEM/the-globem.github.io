# Survey Data

## Data Files

The `SurveyData` folder contains five files, all indexed by `pid` and `date`:
- `pre.csv`: The file contains all questionnaires that participants filled in right before the start of the data collection study (thus pre-study).
- `post.csv`: The file contains all questionnaires that participants filled in right after the end of the data collection study (thus post-study).
- `ema.csv`: The file contains all EMA surveys that participants filled in during the study. Some EMAs were delivered on Wednesdays, while some were delivered on Sundays.

Our current benchmark takes **depression detection** as the main task. Thus we also prepare the following two files. We envision future work can be extended to other modeling targets as well.
- `dep_weekly.csv`: The specific file for depression labels (column `dep`) combining post and EMA surveys.
- `dep_endterm.csv`: The specific file for depression labels (column `dep`) only in post surveys. Some prior depression detection tasks focus on end-of-term depression prediction.
