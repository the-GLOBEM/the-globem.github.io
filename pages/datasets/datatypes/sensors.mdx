# Feature Data

## Data Files
The `FeatureData` folder contains seven files, all index by `pid` and `date`.
- `rapids.csv`: The complete feature file that contains all features.
- `location.csv`: The feature file that contains all `Location` features.
- `screen.csv`: The feature file that contains all `PhoneUsage` features.
- `call.csv`: The feature file that contains all `Call` features.
- `bluetooth.csv`: The feature file that contains all `Bluetooth` features.
- `steps.csv`: The feature file that contains all `PhysicalActivity` features.
- `sleep.csv`: The feature file that contains all `Sleep` features.
- `wifi.csv`: The feature file that contains all `WiFi` features. Note that this feature type is not used by any existing algorithms and often has a high data missing rate.

## Processing

Please note:
- All features are extracted with multiple `time_segment`s
  - `morning` (6 am - 12 pm, calculated daily)
  - `afternoon` (12 pm - 6 pm, calculated daily)
  - `evening` (6 pm - 12 am, calculated daily)
  - `night` (12 am - 6 am, calculated daily)
  - `allday` (24 hrs from 12 am to 11:59 pm, calculated daily)
  - `7-day history` (calculated daily)
  - `14-day history` (calculated daily)
  - `weekdays` (calculated once per week on Friday)
  - `weekend` (calculated once per week on Sunday)
- For all features with numeric values, we also provide two more versions:
  - `normalized`: subtracted by each participant's median and divided by the 5-95 quantile range
  - `discretized`: low/medium/high split by 33/66 quantile of each participant's feature value

## Naming Format

All features follow a consistent naming format:
`[feature_type]:[feature_name][version]:[time_segment]`
- `feature_type`: It corresponds to the six data types. `location` - `f_loc`, `screen` - `f_screen`, `call` - `f_call`, `bluetooth` - `f_blue`, `steps` - `f_steps`, `sleep` - `f_slp`.
- `feature_name`: The name of the feature provided by RAPIDS, *i.e.*, the second column of the following figure, plus some additional information. A typical format is `[SensorType]_[CodeProvider]_[featurename]`. Please refer to [RAPIDS's naming format](https://www.rapids.science/1.6/features/feature-introduction/) for more details.
- `version`: It has three versions: 1) nothing, just empty `""`; 2) normalized, `_norm`; 3) discretized, `_dis`.
- `time_segment`: It corresponds to the specific time segment. `morning` - `morning`, `afternoon` - `afternoon`, `evening` - `evening`, `night` - `night`, `allday` - `allday`, `7-day history` - `7dhist`, `14-day history` - `14dhist`, `weekday` - `weekday`, `weekend` - `weekend`.

A participant's `sumdurationunlock` normalized feature in mornings is `f_loc:phone_screen_rapids_sumdurationunlock_norm:morning`.
